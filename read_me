This repository holds the code for the research project "The jaguars of the Paranapiacaba Remnant: individual identification, population estimate and appropriation by society".

Project abstract:

The jaguar (Panthera onca), the top predator in the Neotropics, originally occupied all of South and Central America to southwestern North America, but currently occurs in only 54% of its original distribution, being classified globally as Nearly Threatened (NT), in Brazil as Vulnerable to Extinction (VU) and, in the Atlantic Forest, as Critically Endangered, for having a population of less than 250 adults, decreasing continuously due to hunting and loss of quality habitat, habitat and prey base.
This project, which has been conducted since 2008, estimated the jaguar population in the Paranapiacaba Continuum, (PE Intervales, PE Carlos Botelho, PE Nascentes do Paranapanema, PETAR, EE Xitué and large neighboring private forests) one of the core areas for the conservation of the species in the Atlantic Forest, with a density of 0.29 -1.17 individuals/100 km2, or about 20 individuals. The data that supported this estimate were obtained from 2009 to 2011. Since then, very relevant events for the conservation of the species have occurred: a good part of the Paranapiacaba Continuum has been reoccupied by peccaries, Tayassu pecari, one of the main prey of the jaguar throughout its entire geographic distribution; on the other hand, known jaguars and others of relevance to the population of the Continuum were murdered by hunters.

Empathy for animals is an important factor in the motivation to act in favor of conservation. In this sense, the individual appreciation of animals from flag species has immense potential for mobilization, as recently evidenced by the commotion caused by the murder of the lion Cecil. The photographic monitoring  of jaguars carried out by this project in the Mosaic of Paranapiacaba has enabled the inference of life stories and family relationships among the jaguars in the area and confirmed the potential to mobilize society in favor of the species' conservation.
Therefore, currently the objectives of the project are to update the estimated jaguar population of the Paranapiacaba Continuum, to establish the beginning of the program to identify jaguar individuals in the coastal Atlantic Forest of São Paulo and to enhance society awareness about the  jaguars of the Paranapiacaba Continuum, as individuals with unique life stories and family relationships, promoting society's sense of familiarity with the species and its conservation.
